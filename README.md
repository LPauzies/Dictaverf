# Russia Internship

## Project topic

 Association dictionary project was started in 2012 and is still active. Originally it was developed for French language (http://dictaverf.nsu.ru), but later developed engine was used for Russian (http://adictru.nsu.ru) and Sakha languages as well. Five years ago, we look at this project as a tool which helped us to analyze some data, so our implementation was limited in terms of functionality and future development. Now we see which functionality required and we suggest you implement some features :  
1. Cloud of words (like this [Cloud of words : example](http://dictaverf.nsu.ru/graphs/index_cloud.html)) 
There are several Javascripts which implement this functionality on the client side. You need to analyze those implementations, select more suitable and integrate this functionality into our project.  

2. Statistical charts (one of them is like this one [Statistical charts : example](http://dictaverf.nsu.ru/graphs/index_charts.html)). We need several charts to compare respondents from different areas. Once again there are several implementations. You will analyze them, select one, integrate, configure, and test.

Others ways to explore the topic :  
1. I showed to you the site and two pages: one  -- with graphs, another with a cloud of words. We want you to think how to integrate this  functionality in the site in a more convenient way. Probably you will suggest a way how to reorganize page layout to be more user friendly.  Once you complete this task you can join another task devoted to the dict.  

2. We want you to think about the way to answer the question why respondent gave exactly this or that response for this or that stimulus. For example I can pass the pair of stimulus-response to Google and retrieve some information from topics Google returns. Questions: way to represent it, should it be an image or a set of text documents?  way to ask Google, if there any other approach?  

3. We want to carry out another set of experiments and want to attract peoples over the world. Who will will helping us? A few guys? a dozen?  But we want to have dozen thousands and more. So the idea is to turn the experiment in a game like "give 25 answers and we will tell you from where you are". In a questionnaire of individual person you can find the third column with numbers and percentage. This is how this person looks the same to the whole set of respondents. But we can perform some kind of classification and tell if the guy leave in Canada or France. Which part of France. What his/her education or age is. Here we  need to solve a real set of technical problems (spelling, normalization, etc.) and it would be easier for me to describe them personally.
